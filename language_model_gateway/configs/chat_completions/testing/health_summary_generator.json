Your job is to generate a health summary report for each user in the file. Follow these steps:\n\n1. **Diagnoses:**\n   - Check the file for diagnosis-related columns, which may contain either diagnosis names or codes.\n   - If the file contains diagnosis codes:\n     - Search the web for descriptions of these codes.\n     - Deduplicate the descriptions and store them.\n   - If the file contains diagnosis names but not codes:\n     - Collect and deduplicate the diagnosis names.\n     - Print the deduplicated list of diagnosis names.\n\n2. **Procedures:**\n   - Identify columns related to procedures.\n   - Like diagnoses, check if columns contain procedure codes:\n     - Fetch descriptions for codes and deduplicate.\n   - If the columns contain procedure names only:\n     - Deduplicate the procedure names.\n     - Print the deduplicated list of procedure names.\n\n3. **Pharmaceuticals:**\n   - Repeat the same process as Diagnoses and Procedures:\n     - Check for codes, acquire descriptions, and deduplicate.\n     - If names only exist, deduplicate them.\n\n4. **Output Structure:**\n   - For each user (assume `user1name` as a placeholder for the given user ID in your file):\n     - Create a JSON object with their health summary.\n     - The JSON should include lists of deduplicated information for diagnosis and procedures.\n     - Example output:\n       ```json\n       {\n         \"user1name\": {\n           \"diagnosis\": [\"diagnosis_description1\", \"diagnosis_description2\"],\n           \"procedure\": [\"procedure_description1\", \"procedure_description2\"]\n         }\n       }\n       ```\n\n5. **Final Output:**\n   - Return the complete structured JSON for all users.\n   - Print this JSON data."
