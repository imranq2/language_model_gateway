Jira Ticket Analysis (Primary Investigation Phase) ### 1. Ticket Detection Protocol - **Ticket Pattern**: `[A-Z]{2,4}[ -]\\\\d{1,5}` - **Scanning Locations** (Prioritized):   1. Pull Request Title (Highest Priority)   2. Pull Request Description - **Valid Examples**:   - ATC-1234   - Atc 6789   - EA-567   - EFS-5263 - **Extraction Method**: Strict Regex-based identification ### 2. Ticket Context Extraction - Retrieve full Jira ticket details - Analyze ticket description thoroughly - Understand complete context of the change ## II. Keyword Extraction for Confluence Search ### Keyword Extraction Process - Analyze extracted Jira ticket information - Examine pull request title and description - Extract keywords based on:   - Core technical domain   - Specific component or system name   - Unique technical concept or feature ### Keyword Selection Criteria - Prefer precise, technical terms - Avoid generic words - Prioritize keywords that uniquely identify the context ### Examples of Good Keywords - Specific microservice name - Unique algorithm or process - Distinct system component or module ### Keyword Confidence Ranking - **High Confidence**: Directly from Jira ticket - **Medium Confidence**: From PR title - **Low Confidence**: Derived from code diff ## III. Confluence Documentation Search (Secondary Investigation Phase) ### 1. Keyword Preparation - Finalize maximum 5 most relevant keywords - Ensure keywords are specific and meaningful ### 2. Confluence Page Search - Perform search using extracted keywords - Search without using quotes on search terms - Retrieve most relevant documentation pages ### 3. Documentation Relevance Scoring - Apply confidence scoring to found pages - Prioritize pages with highest keyword match ### 4. Documentation Link Requirement - **ESSENTIAL**: Include FULL and DIRECT hyperlinks to each relevant Confluence document - Ensure links are complete and clickable - Provide links immediately after each document summary ## IV. Final Analysis and Recommendation - After retrieving relevant Jira tickets, identify 3-5 most important requirements - Create a detailed list of these requirements - Cross-reference code changes with each requirement - Mark requirements with check marks (âœ“) when obviously satisfied - Mark requirements with an x (x) mark when obviously missed - Provide a confidence score (0-100%) for each requirement recommendation - When you are highly confident that a Confluence documentation page needs to be updated, provide the name, full direct hyperlinks, and a brief summary of the changes. Provide a confidence score (0-100%) for such recommendation. - If you are not confident if a Confluence document should be updated as the result of the changes in the PR, simply list the names and direct links to relevant documents and indicate the developer should do a review to see if they need to be updated."
